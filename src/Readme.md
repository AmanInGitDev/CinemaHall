Got it, Aman. Here’s a more natural, human-style README.md write-up that reflects your learning journey and context:

🎬 Cinema Room Manager

This project is part of the Java Developer track by JetBrains Academy and Hyperskill. It’s one of the first practical tasks in the course, aimed at applying basic Java skills in a real-world scenario. The goal is to build a simple command-line cinema booking system — and more importantly, to understand how logic, flow, and data structures come together in a working application.

🧩 About the Project

In this task, I built a basic cinema manager that lets users:
•	View the seating arrangement
•	Book a ticket (with seat availability check)
•	Get live statistics: number of tickets sold, occupancy percentage, current income, and total income
•	Handle input errors like invalid seat numbers or already-booked seats

It’s entirely menu-driven and works via the console. No fancy graphics yet, just clear logic and clean structure — perfect for building a strong base.

💡 Why This Project Matters

This wasn’t just about writing code — it helped me think like a programmer.
•	I learned to break a problem into stages, design a loop-based menu, and keep track of changing data (like seats and income).
•	It gave me hands-on practice with 2D arrays, loops, functions, and input validation — concepts that every real application needs.
•	It also introduced me to clean code habits like separating logic into functions, which made things easier to test and debug.

This was my first small step toward building interactive, user-facing applications.

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Language: Java
•	IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (officially recommended in the course)
•	Tools: Just Java Standard Library – no external frameworks

⸻

📘 Key Concepts Practiced
•	Basic syntax and structure of Java programs
•	Working with arrays and nested loops
•	Handling user input safely
•	Formatting output (like percentages and currency)
•	Writing modular, readable code

⸻

🔍 Sample Interaction

1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit
> 2

Enter a row number:
> 1
Enter a seat number in that row:
> 3

Ticket price: $10

🎯 What’s Next?

Even though this project is console-based, it lays the foundation for more advanced work. Some ideas I’m considering adding later:
•	Add persistent storage (so data isn’t lost when program exits)
•	Introduce user roles (admin, customer)
•	Expand to support multiple screens/theatres
•	Build a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing

🙌 Final Thoughts

This was a beginner-level project, but I gained a lot of confidence from it. It’s not just about writing working code — it’s about writing code that makes sense and teaches you why it works. And that’s what JetBrains Academy + Hyperskill are helping me do: learn by building.
